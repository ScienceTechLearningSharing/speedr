===

Android app that measures how much time, or how little time, you save by speeding in your car. It is good to remind us that driving faster only saves couples of minutes at best but with a cost of potential catastrophic accident!

[Download from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jakehilborn.speedr.prod) or click the releases tab to download the apk.
